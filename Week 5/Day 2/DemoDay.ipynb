And they hated him yet the more for his\\ndreams, and for his words.\\n{37:9} And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his\\nbrethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more;\\nand, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars\\nmade obeisance to me. {37:10} And he told [it] to his\\nfather, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and\\nsaid unto him, What [is] this dream that thou hast dreamed?\\nShall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow\\ndown ourselves to thee to the earth? {37:11} And his\\nbrethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.\\n{37:12} And his brethren went to feed their father's flock\\nin Shechem. {37:13} And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not\\nthy brethren feed [the flock] in Shechem? come, and I will\\nsend thee unto them. And he said to him, Here [am] I.\\n{37:14} And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it\\nbe well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and\\nbring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of\\nHebron, and he came to Shechem.\\n{37:15} And a certain man found him, and, behold, [he\\nwas] wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying,\\nWhat seekest thou? {37:16} And he said, I seek my\\nbrethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed [their flocks.\\n]{37:17} And the man said, They are departed hence; for I\\nheard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after\\nhis brethren, and found them in Dothan. {37:18} And when\\nthey saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them,\\nthey conspired against him to slay him. {37:19} And they\\nsaid one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. {37:20}Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into\\nsome pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured\\nhim: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.\\n{37:21} And Reuben heard [it,] and he delivered him out of\\ntheir hands; and said, Let us not kill him. {37:22} And\\nReuben said unto them, Shed no blood, [but] cast him into\\nthis pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;\\nthat he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to\\nhis father again.\\n{37:23} And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto\\nhis brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, [his] coat\\nof [many] colours that [was] on him; {37:24} And they took\\nhim, and cast him into a pit: and the pit [was] empty, [there\\nwas] no water in it. {37:25} And they sat down to eat bread:\\nand they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a\\ncompany of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels\\nbearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry [it]\\ndown to Egypt. {37:26} And Judah said unto his brethren,\\nWhat profit [is it] if we slay our brother, and conceal his\\nblood? {37:27} Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites,\\nand let not our hand be upon him; for he [is] our brother\\n[and] our flesh. And his brethren were content. {37:28}\\nThen there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they\\ndrew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to\\nthe Ishmeelites for twenty [pieces] of silver: and they\\nbrought Joseph into Egypt.\\n{37:29} And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold,\\nJoseph [was] not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. {37:30}\\nAnd he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child [is]\\nnot; and I, whither shall I go? {37:31} And they took\\nJoseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the\\ncoat in the blood; {37:32} And they sent the coat of [many]\\ncolours, and they brought [it] to their father; and said, This\\nhave we found: know now whether it [be] thy son's coat or\\nno. {37:33} And he knew it, and said, [It is] my son's coat;\\nan evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt\\nrent in pieces. {37:34} And Jacob rent his clothes, and put\\nsackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many\\ndays. {37:35} And all his sons and all his daughters rose up\\nto comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said,\\nFor I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning.\\nThus his father wept for him. {37:36} And the Midianites\\nsold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's,\\n[and] captain of the guard.\\n{38:1} And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went\\ndown from his brethren, and turned in to a certain\\nAdullamite, whose name [was] Hirah. {38:2} And Judah\\nsaw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name\\n[was] Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. {38:3}\\nAnd she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name\\nEr. {38:4} And she conceived again, and bare a son; and\\nshe called his name Onan. {38:5} And she yet again\\nconceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and\\nhe was at Chezib, when she bare him. {38:6} And Judah\\ntook a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name [was] Tamar.\\n{38:7} And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of\\nthe LORD; and the LORD slew him. {38:8} And Judah said\\nunto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her,\\nand raise up seed to thy brother. {38:9} And Onan knew\\nthat the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he\\nwent in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled [it] on the\\nground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. {38:10}\\nAnd the thing which he did displeased the LORD:\\nwherefore he slew him also. {38:11} Then said Judah to\\nTamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's\\nhouse, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest\\nperadventure he die also, as his brethren [did.] And Tamar\\nwent and dwelt in her father's house.\\nperadventure he die also, as his brethren [did.] And Tamar\\nwent and dwelt in her father's house.\\n\""

{7:14} They, and\\nevery beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind,\\nand every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after\\nhis kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every\\nsort. {7:15} And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two\\nand two of all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life. {7:16}\\nAnd they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,\\nas God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.\\n{7:17} And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the\\nwaters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up\\nabove the earth. {7:18} And the waters prevailed, and were\\nincreased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the\\nface of the waters. {7:19} And the waters prevailed\\nexceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that\\n[were] under the whole heaven, were covered. {7:20}\\nFifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the\\nmountains were covered. {7:21} And all flesh died that\\nmoved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of\\nbeast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the\\nearth, and every man: {7:22} All in whose nostrils [was] the\\nbreath of life, of all that [was] in the dry [land,] died. {7:23}\\nAnd every living substance was destroyed which was upon\\nthe face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the\\ncreeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were\\ndestroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained [alive,]\\nand they that [were] with him in the ark. {7:24} And the\\nwaters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.\\n{8:1} And God remembered Noah, and every living thing,\\nand all the cattle that [was] with him in the ark: and God\\nmade a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters\\nasswaged; {8:2} The fountains also of the deep and the\\nwindows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven\\nwas restrained; {8:3} And the waters returned from off the\\nearth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty\\ndays the waters were abated. {8:4} And the ark rested in the\\nseventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon\\nthe mountains of Ararat. {8:5} And the waters decreased\\ncontinually until the tenth month: in the tenth [month,] on\\nthe first [day] of the month, were the tops of the mountains\\nseen.\\n{8:6} And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that\\nNoah opened the window of the ark which he had made:\\n{8:7} And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and\\nfro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. {8:8}Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were\\nabated from off the face of the ground; {8:9} But the dove\\nfound no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto\\nhim into the ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the\\nwhole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and\\npulled her in unto him into the ark. {8:10} And he stayed\\nyet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of\\nthe ark; {8:11} And the dove came in to him in the evening;\\nand, lo, in her mouth [was] an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah\\nknew that the waters were abated from off the earth. {8:12}\\nAnd he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;\\nwhich returned not again unto him any more.\\n{8:13} And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first\\nyear, in the first [month,] the first [day] of the month, the\\nwaters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed\\nthe covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of\\nthe ground was dry. {8:14} And in the second month, on the\\nseven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.\\n{8:15} And God spake unto Noah, saying, {8:16} Go\\nforth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy\\nsons' wives with thee. {8:17} Bring forth with thee every\\nliving thing that [is] with thee, of all flesh, [both] of fowl,\\nand of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon\\nthe earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and\\nbe fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. {8:18} And Noah\\nwent forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives\\nwith him: {8:19} Every beast, every creeping thing, and\\nevery fowl, [and] whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after\\ntheir kinds, went forth out of the ark.\\n{8:20} And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and\\ntook of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and\\noffered burnt offerings on the altar. {8:21} And the LORD\\nsmelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I\\nwill not again curse the ground any more for man's sake;\\nfor the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth;\\nneither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I\\nhave done. {8:22} While the earth remaineth, seedtime and\\nharvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day\\nand night shall not cease.\\n{9:1} And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto\\nthem, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\\n{9:2} And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be\\nupon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the\\nair, upon all that moveth [upon] the earth, and upon all the\\nfishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. {9:3}\\nEvery moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even\\nas the green herb have I given you all things. {9:4} But\\nflesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall\\nye not eat. {9:5} And surely your blood of your lives will I\\nrequire; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at\\nthe hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I\\nrequire the life of man. {9:6} Whoso sheddeth man's blood,\\nby man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God\\nmade he man. {9:7} And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply;\\nbring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.\\n{9:8} And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with\\nhim, saying, {9:9} And I, behold, I establish my covenant\\nwith you, and with your seed after you; {9:10} And with\\nevery living creature that [is] with you, of the fowl, of the\\ncattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that\\ngo out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. {9:11} And I\\nwill establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh\\nbe cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall\\nthere any more be a flood to destroy the earth. {9:12} And\\nGod said, This [is] the token of the covenant which I make\\nbetween me and you and every living creature that [is] with\\nyou, for perpetual generations: \""

These both were cast alive\\ninto a lake of fire burning with brimstone. {19:21} And the\\nremnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the\\nhorse, which [sword] proceeded out of his mouth: and all\\nthe fowls were filled with their flesh.\\n{20:1} And I saw an angel come down from heaven,\\nhaving the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his\\nhand. {20:2} And he laid hold on the dragon, that old\\nserpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a\\nthousand years, {20:3} And cast him into the bottomless pit,\\nand shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should\\ndeceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should\\nbe fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.\\n{20:4} And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and\\njudgment was given unto them: and [I saw] the souls of\\nthem that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for\\nthe word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast,\\nneither his image, neither had received [his] mark upon their\\nforeheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with\\nChrist a thousand years. {20:5} But the rest of the dead\\nlived not again until the thousand years were finished. This\\n[is] the first resurrection. {20:6} Blessed and holy [is] he\\nthat hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second\\ndeath hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of\\nChrist, and shall reign with him a thousand years. {20:7}\\nAnd when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be\\nloosed out of his prison, {20:8} And shall go out to deceive\\nthe nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog\\nand Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of\\nwhom [is] as the sand of the sea. {20:9} And they went up\\non the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the\\nsaints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from\\nGod out of heaven, and devoured them. {20:10} And the\\ndevil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and\\nbrimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are,] andshall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.\\n{20:11} And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat\\non it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away;\\nand there was found no place for them. {20:12} And I saw\\nthe dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books\\nwere opened: and another book was opened, which is [the\\nbook] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things\\nwhich were written in the books, according to their works.\\n{20:13} And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and\\ndeath and hell delivered up the dead which were in them:\\nand they were judged every man according to their works.\\n{20:14} And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.\\nThis is the second death. {20:15} And whosoever was not\\nfound written in the book of life was cast into the lake of\\nfire.\\n{21:1} And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the\\nfirst heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there\\nwas no more sea. {21:2} And I John saw the holy city, new\\nJerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared\\nas a bride adorned for her husband. {21:3} And I heard a\\ngreat voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of\\nGod [is] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they\\nshall be his people, and God himself shall be with them,\\n[and be] their God. {21:4} And God shall wipe away all\\ntears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,\\nneither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more\\npain: for the former things are passed away. {21:5} And he\\nthat sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.\\nAnd he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and\\nfaithful. {21:6} And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha\\nand Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him\\nthat is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.\\n{21:7} He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will\\nbe his God, and he shall be my son. {21:8} But the fearful,\\nand unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and\\nwhoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars,\\nshall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and\\nbrimstone: which is the second death.\\n{21:9} And there came unto me one of the seven angels\\nwhich had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and\\ntalked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the\\nbride, the Lamb's wife. {21:10} And he carried me away in\\nthe spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that\\ngreat city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven\\nfrom God, {21:11} Having the glory of God: and her light\\n[was] like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper\\nstone, clear as crystal; {21:12} And had a wall great and\\nhigh, [and] had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels,\\nand names written thereon, which are [the names] of the\\ntwelve tribes of the children of Israel: {21:13} On the east\\nthree gates; on the north three gates; on the south three\\ngates; and on the west three gates. {21:14} And the wall of\\nthe city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of\\nthe twelve apostles of the Lamb. {21:15} And he that talked\\nwith me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates\\nthereof, and the wall thereof. {21:16} And the city lieth\\nfoursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he\\nmeasured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.\\nThe length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.\\n{21:17} And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred\\n[and] forty [and] four cubits, [according to] the measure of a\\nman, that is, of the angel. {21:18} And the building of the\\nwall of it was [of] jasper: and the city [was] pure gold, like\\nunto clear glass. {21:19} And the foundations of the wall of\\nthe city [were] garnished with all manner of precious stones.\\nThe first foundation [was] jasper; the second, sapphire; the\\nthird, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; \""

       "Document(id_='7198855', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Matthew Joseph West (born April 25, 1977) is an American contemporary Christian musician and singer-songwriter. He has released five studio albums and is known for his songs \"More\", \"You Are Everything\", and \"The Motions\". He was nominated for five Dove Awards in 2005, two of which were for his major-label debut album, Happy. West won the 2013 American Music Award for Best Contemporary Inspirational Artist.\\nStarting as an independent musician in the late 1990s, he released three independent albums before signing with Universal South Records. With the release of his Dove Award-winning debut album, Happy, released in 2003, his first radio single, \"More\", stayed at No. 1 on Christian Adult Contemporary charts for nine weeks and received two Dove Award nominations. His second album, History, was followed by a 2006 re-release of the originally independent album Sellout. In 2007, his career was threatened by vocal issues that required vocal-cord surgery followed by two months of prescribed vocal rest. His third studio album, Something to Say, also enjoyed chart success with No. 1 hits \"You Are Everything\" and \"The Motions\".\\nIn addition to his main solo career, West has worked as a songwriter for many Christian musicians and groups, such as Point of Grace, Mandisa, Natalie Grant, and Casting Crowns, as well as mainstream country acts Rascal Flatts, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Vince Gill. In 2013, his second single, \"Hello, My Name Is\", from the album Into the Light, was released and reached No. 1 for a career-best 17 consecutive weeks on the Billboard Christian Songs chart.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nMatthew West was born on April 25, 1977, in Downers Grove, Illinois. As a child he was a fan of his hometown baseball team, the Chicago Cubs, and wanted to eventually have a career in baseball. He played baseball throughout high school at Downers Grove North High School, becoming team captain as a senior; he also performed in the school\\'s Chamber Choir. He was hoping for a college baseball scholarship but instead ended up receiving a four-year music scholarship at Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois where he was a part of the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship chapter. He graduated from Millikin in 1999.\\n\\n\\n== Musical career ==\\nWest wrote most of his first songs in the sanctuary of his father\\'s church while he was at home during college breaks. According to a statement by West at the 2013 Winter Jam (March 23, 2013), at a 1997 Steven Curtis Chapman at the Assembly Hall in Champaign-Urbana, West was crying profusely, prompting his friends to ask him what was wrong.  He said that he was being led by Jesus to pursue a career in singing and\\nsongwriting.\\nHe was a songwriter and independent musician from 1997 to 2002, releasing three albums: September Sun (1997), Every Step of the Way (1998), and Sellout (2002). In October 1997, he went on a three-city tour to support the release of September Sun.\\nJust before West graduated from Millikin University in 1999, someone from the college recommended that he attend the GMA Music in the Rockies event for aspiring musicians. Although West was not interested at first, he attended after learning that other people signed him up and paid his entrance fee. He met a representative from Word Publishing at the event who took interest in him and kept in contact until he graduated. West landed in the finals of a songwriting competition and was offered a songwriting deal in July 1999, five weeks after graduating. After penning songs for well-known musicians like Billy Ray Cyrus and Rachael Lampa, he began touring the United States as an independent artist in 2000 and 2001.\\n\\nOn July 26, 2002, only a week or two before signing a record contract with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which jeopardized his musical career and guitar playing. He says, \"I locked myself out of my house. But I\\'d done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked out in the middle of the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital.\" West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, a major artery having come very close to being severed. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.\\n\\n\\n=== Happy (2003–2004) ===\\n\\nAfter signing with Universal South Records on August 23, 2002, West released his first non-independent studio album, Happy, on December 26, 2003. The album\\'s producers Kenny Greenberg and Jason Houser co-wrote the song \"More\" with West. The track was his first and most successful radio single to date, staying at No. 1 on R&R\\'s Christian Adult Contemporary chart for a record-breaking nine weeks. It was the most played Christian AC song of 2004 and went on to be labelled the Christian Song of the Year by ASCAP. Two additional songs, \"The End\" and \"You Know Where to Find Me\", were also released as singles off the album. Beginning in late September 2004, West joined Avalon and Mark Schultz on a 40-city fall tour, which concluded at the end of November. In 2005, he was nominated for five Dove Awards, including \"New Artist of the Year\" and \"Song of the Year\". He won the \"Recorded Music Packaging of the Year\" Dove Award for his debut album Happy.\\nIn early 2005, he was on the WinterJam 2005 tour, hosted by NewSong, with tobyMac, Building 429, Tait, and Rachael Lampa.\\n\\n\\n=== History and vocal problems (2005–2007) ===\\n\\nWith Kenny Greenberg and Jason Houser once again as producers, Matthew West began recording for his second studio album in early 2005. History, co-produced by West, was released on June 21, 2005, on Universal South Records. The first single off the album, \"Next Thing You Know\", was released June 20, a day before the album\\'s release. The theme of the title track \"History\" was inspired by a R&R music news headline \"Matthew West Makes History\", in reference to his first album, Happy. \"It\\'s not every day you read a headline like that with your name in it that calls you a history maker,\" he said. Beginning on September 14, 2005, he kicked off the 30-city History 101 tour, his first headlining tour, which included guest musicians Shawn McDonald and Paul Wright. He then joined tobyMac\\'s Winter Wonder Slam tour, beginning on December 1, 2005, along with John Reuben, BarlowGirl, GRITS, and DJ Maj. Two additional songs were released off History as singles: \"Only Grace\" and the title track \"History\".\\nHis independent album Sellout was re-released in 2006 on Universal South Records.\\nWest said that he began to experience \"some vocal fatigue\" in April 2007. He said, \"I had lost some of my vocal range, staying on higher notes and lower notes. I even began having a hard time speaking.\" At a vocal check-up in response to the issue, West\\'s doctors at the Nashville Vanderbilt Voice Center discovered \"hemorrhaging caused by some polyps\". He was told by his doctors that vocal surgery was the only option, since a few weeks had passed. The surgery took place on May 17, 2007, a process that he said was \"career threatening.\" Afterward, he was prescribed a two-month period of silence for vocal rest.\\nA video documentary titled Nothing to Say, directed and produced by Benjamin Eisner, was released in early 2008, highlighting Matthew West\\'s time of silence and vocal recovery in 2007. In February 2008, the documentary was available exclusively in Family Christian Stores as a CD/DVD combo pack with West\\'s album Something to Say.\\n\\n\\n=== Something to Say (2008–2010) ===\\nHis next single \"You Are Everything\" was released in late 2007. The song was available as a free download from West\\'s website. He also recorded a duet (\"Christmas Makes Me Cry\") with American Idol finalist Mandisa, which was released as a Christmas radio single in November 2007, from Mandisa\\'s Christmas Joy EP.\\nMatthew West\\'s album Something to Say was released on January 15, 2008. It reached No. 8 on Billboard\\'s Top Christian albums chart, and peaked at No. 159 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it his first Billboard 200 album . It was produced by Brown Bannister, Ed Cash, and Christopher Stevens. West said in an interview that all of the album\\'s songs had already been written and the title \"Something to Say\" had already been decided \"months before I found out that I was going to have nothing to say.\" The first radio single released from the album was \"You Are Everything\". In March 2008, the song reached No. 1 on R&R\\'s Christian AC chart. \"Something to Say\", the album\\'s title track, was also released to radio, receiving airplay in June 2008.\\nMatthew West guested on tobyMac\\'s 26-city \"Boomin\\' Beyond Measure\" tour along with Jeremy Camp. The tour ran from February 6 through March 21, 2008.\\nHe was featured on the Billy Graham television special America\\'s Dream: Chasing Happiness, which aired in the U.S. on March 1–9, 2008. The appearance included a world premiere of his music video for \"Nothing Else\", a song from History. On June 29, West hosted GMA\\'s 2008 Gospel Dream, a televised Christian music talent competition. \"The Motions\" was released as his next single, placing at No. 1 on R&R\\'s Christian AC chart in April 2009.\\nIn 2009 he had a song on an album by country artist Jo Dee Messina, with another under consideration by American Idol finalist Danny Gokey. In December 2009, \"The Motions\" was Grammy-nominated for Best Gospel Song, West\\'s first Grammy nomination.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent years (2010–present) ===\\n\\n\"My Own Little World\", the first single from Matthew West\\'s new album, was released on August 23, 2010. The album, The Story of Your Life, was released October 5, 2010. According to West it is a response to thousands of life stories his fans shared with him. \"The first day, I got 1,000 stories. All of a sudden, I was like, \\'Holy cow, something special is about to take place.\\' I rented a cabin in Tennessee, about 25 minutes from my house, that felt like it was out in the middle of nowhere. And I spent two months in that cabin reading 10,000 stories,\" the singer/songwriter reported in an interview with CBN.com.\\nWest also starred in The Heart of Christmas. In 2011, he released a Christmas song featuring Country Music Hall of Fame member Vince Gill entitled \"Leaving Heaven\".\\nInto the Light was released in September 2012. West\\'s Into the Light Tour was in September, October, and November 2013. He released his sixth studio album, Live Forever, on April 28, 2015. His seventh studio album, All In, was set to release on September 22, 2017, to be immediately followed by his All In tour. His single \"The Motions\" was certified Platinum by RIAA.\\nIn February 2020, West released Brand New on his own imprint, Story House Music, under a new deal with Sony\\'s Provident Music Group. A deluxe edition followed in April 2021.\\nOn February 17, 2023, West released a 22-song album titled My Story Your Glory.\\n\\n\\n== Other songwriting ==\\nIn addition to his solo career, Matthew West has also written songs for other Christian bands and musicians, including Mark Schultz, Mandisa, Jump5, Sara Groves, Joy Williams, Casting Crowns, Salvador, Natalie Grant, Danny Gokey, PureNRG, and Point of Grace, as well as mainstream country act Billy Ray Cyrus. Rascal Flatts recorded West\\'s song \"The Day Before You\" on their album Feels Like Today. West co-wrote \"Voice of a Savior\" by Mandisa and \"Thank You\" by 33Miles, both of which were released as singles in early 2008.\\n\\n\\n== Acting ==\\nWest also pursues acting, with occasional appearances in Christian television shows, starting in 2009. In 2011, he made his film debut in Gary Wheeler\\'s Christian film The Heart of Christmas co-starring Candace Cameron Bure. At the end of 2011 it reached a rating of 7.1 on IMDb after a direct-to-TV release.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\nMatthew West currently lives in Nashville with his wife Emily. They were married on May 10, 2003, after proposing to her in September 2002. They have two daughters. The Wests have two dogs named Nick and Rocky.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n\\n\\n=== American Music Awards ===\\n\\n\\n=== GMA Dove Awards ===\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')"
